## The idea behind it ##

WP Juggler is a product of [BoldThemes](https://bold-themes.com/) need to efficiently manage more than [100 demo sites](https://themeforest.net/user/boldthemes/portfolio) showcasing our premium WordPress themes and more than 200 websites coming from our agency work.

We urgently needed to say goodbye to the havoc of website chaos and reduce the everlasting maintenance headache. The existing solutions were either inadquate, too expensive or not good enough. 

So we have created WP Juggler

2. Install WP Juggler Client plugins on sites you want to manage
3. Register your sites to the server in a single click of a button

## ToDo List ##

1. Alert email templates
2. Plugin installation (both locally hosted and from WordPress.org)
3. Vulnerability check of installed themes and WP Core
4. Checksum of themes from WordPress.org
5. Client Reports on Activities
