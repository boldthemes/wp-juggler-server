# WP Juggler #

WP Juggler is your ultimate solution for effectively managing an unlimited portfolio of WordPress sites from a single, intuitive dashboard. 

WP Juggler helps you to enhance your operational efficiency, ensure your sites stay current with updates, and reclaim precious time to focus on more impactful projects. 

Being an open-source and completely free tool, WP Juggler is designed to revolutionize your WordPress maintenance experience without costing you a dime.

## The idea behind it ##

WP Juggler is a product of [BoldThemes'](https://bold-themes.com/) need to efficiently manage more than [100 demo sites](https://themeforest.net/user/boldthemes/portfolio) showcasing our premium WordPress themes and more than 200 websites resulting from our agency work.

Before the creation of WP Juggler, managing multiple sites was a chaotic, time-consuming process that often resulted in costly maintenance issues. The solutions available in the market were either inadquate, overpriced or fell short in efficient functionality. 

So we have created WP Juggler

## How does it work - Main concepts ##

WP Juggler has two components:

- WP Juggler Server plugin - This repository
- [WP Juggler Client plugin](https://github.com/boldthemes/wp-juggler-client)


> [!NOTE]
> WP Juggler Server is a self-hosted WordPress plugin which features control panel for centralized WordPress management of your sites.

> This means that the data governance within your network is entirely under your control.

2. Check **Automatic Login**, enter **Remote Login Username** (username of the user you are going to log in on the target site) and click **Save**

### Setup your crons ###
WP Juggler uses WP Cron system to automatically refresh remote site data. 

You can set the refresh frequency by navigating to **WP Juggler > Settings** in your server's wp-admin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The WordPress cron system is activated automatically based on a page view / init action. 
> This means that if you do not have visits on your server site, the WP Cron will not fire and no data will be automatically retreived. This includes uptime crons.

### Solution for crons ###
Therefore it is best to set up a cronjob to call the wp-cron.php file in the root of your server WordPress install every 5 minutes, otherwise your scheduled tasks may not run correctly. 

Depending on your hosting environment, there is more than one way to do this.

Here is the general explanation from WordPress plugin handbook on how to this: [Hooking WP-Cron Into the System Task Scheduler](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/)

On most hostings you can do this on your hosting control panel or hosting dashboard. Here is the explanation from [SiteGround](https://eu.siteground.com/tutorials/wordpress/real-cron-job/). 

Contact your hosting support if needed.
